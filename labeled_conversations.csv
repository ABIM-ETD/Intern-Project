"This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.","Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: I'm feeling a bit better, thank you.
Doctor: I see from your clinical notes that you were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I had a fever, dry cough, and difficulty breathing.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During your hospital stay, you encountered some difficulties during physical therapy. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.
Doctor: I see. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, the medical team instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. How did that approach work for you?
Patient: It worked well. A position change to the 135° prone position took around 30 minutes, but it increased my oxygen saturation.
Doctor: That's great to hear. The breathing exercises had to be adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Sure. I was instructed to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, I managed to increase my oxygen saturation.
Doctor: That's excellent. During physical activity, you had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation. How did the medical team help you with that?
Patient: They closely monitored me and gave me frequent breaks. I managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.
Doctor: I see that exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10. Do you have any questions for me?
Patient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Please make sure to follow up with your rehabilitation clinic and take good care of yourself.",1,1,2,1,1,2
"A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks. The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so great, I've been hospitalized for a while now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your general health condition?
Patient: I've been experiencing persistent fever and dry cough for the past two weeks.
Doctor: Okay. And have you been needing oxygen?
Patient: Yes, I initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen.
Doctor: I see. And how has your breathing been, particularly when you're at rest?
Patient: My breathing has been rapid and shallow at rest and severely breathless during minor physical activities.
Doctor: I understand. Have you been receiving physical therapy?
Patient: Yes, physical therapy has been focusing on educating me about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Has it been helpful?
Patient: It has, but my anxiety and fear of dying have been aggravating my dyspnea and vice versa.
Doctor: I see. That's understandable. Have you been able to walk to the toilet okay?
Patient: No, I've been so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that it's been difficult to walk to the toilet.
Doctor: I understand. The physical therapist has been working on counteracting that vicious circle, right?
Patient: Yes, the physical therapist has been actively listening to me, explaining why I'm experiencing breathlessness, and testing suitable positions to relieve it.
Doctor: That's great. Have you seen any improvement?
Patient: Yes, on day 2, my respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and my oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after doing some deep-breathing exercises.
Doctor: That's fantastic progress. And have your dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate?
Patient: Yes, they have. I've been regaining my self-confidence too.
Doctor: That's wonderful to hear. Has the therapy been shifted to walking and strength training?
Patient: Yes, it has. I've even been able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before my discharge home.",1,1,2,2,2,2
"One week after a positive COVID-19 result this 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation (70%) with worsening tachypnea and dyspnea. Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not great, I've been having trouble breathing and feeling really tired.
Doctor: I see from your charts that you tested positive for COVID-19 a week ago and were admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble breathing and it's been getting worse. I've been feeling really short of breath and have been breathing really fast.
Doctor: I understand. Physical therapy was started immediately after your admission to the ICU. Did you notice any changes in your symptoms with the therapy?
Patient: Yeah, the physical therapists were really helpful. With their guidance, I was able to achieve a prone position and do some deep-breathing exercises. My oxygen levels went up from 88% to 96%.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Intensive physical therapy and positioning continued over the next few days, and intubation was avoided. Were there any challenges you faced during this time?
Patient: Yeah, it was really hard to get into the prone position because of my reduced respiratory capacity. But the physical therapists were able to adapt the therapy to my needs and I was able to do it at my own pace.
Doctor: I see. It's important to monitor patients closely to ensure a safe implementation of therapy. After three days with this regime, you were transferred to the normal ward where physical therapists carried on your rehabilitation with walking and strength training. How did you feel during this time?
Patient: I was really unstable at first, but the physical therapists were able to work with me to improve my strength and stability. It was challenging, but I was able to leave the hospital on foot after nine days.
Doctor: That's a great outcome. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and following up with physical therapy as needed. Do you have any questions or concerns?
Patient: No, I think I understand what I need to do. Thank you for your help.
Doctor: Of course, take care and stay healthy. And please let us know if you or your family have any further concerns.",1,1,1,1,1,2
"This 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after a dry cough for 2 weeks, oxygenation was poor and computer tomographic imaging showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss. The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support.","Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not very good, doctor. I've been really sick.
Doctor: I see. When were you admitted to the hospital?
Patient: I was admitted about a month ago.
Doctor: And what brought you in?

Doctor: Ah, I see. Did you have any imaging done?
Patient: Yes, they did a tomographic imaging and found I had typical COVID-19 pneumonia.
Doctor: I see. And what treatments did you receive?
Patient: I received lung-protective ventilation and sedation.
Doctor: And were you positioned in a certain way?
Patient: Yes, they did passive mobilization and positioning into a side-edge position.
Doctor: I see. Unfortunately, it seems like your condition deteriorated. Did you experience any hemodynamic instability?
Patient: Yes, I did. It was really severe.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. And it looks like you developed ARDS as well.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Were you put into prone positioning at any point?
Patient: Yes, intermittently.
Doctor: And did you receive continuous renal replacement therapy?
Patient: Yes, I did.
